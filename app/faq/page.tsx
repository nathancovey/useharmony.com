                  What is Harmony and how does it work?
                </AccordionTrigger>
                <AccordionContent className="text-muted-foreground">
                  Harmony is an AI-powered voice assistant that integrates with your Gmail and Google Calendar to help you manage email and scheduling hands-free. After connecting your Gmail and Calendar accounts, you can simply tap your inbox and start chatting with the assistant using voice commands. You can ask it to read your emails, delete messages, send replies, move emails to folders, unsubscribe from lists, check your calendar, create events, and manage your schedule.

                <AccordionContent className="text-muted-foreground">
                  Absolutely. We take privacy seriously with multiple safeguards: emails are never sent without confirmation, emails cannot be permanently deleted (mistakes are recoverable), none of your emails are stored or saved by us, and all connections are secure and encrypted. We never sell your data to anyone, period. Your data is only used to personalize the Harmony product - nothing more.

                <AccordionContent className="text-muted-foreground">
                  Harmony can handle a wide variety of voice commands including: “Can you catch me up on my most recent emails?”, “Delete that first email”, “Move all these emails to my receipts folder”, “Write a draft reply”, “Send this email”, “Unsubscribe me from this list”, “What’s on my calendar today?”, “Schedule a meeting for tomorrow at 2pm”, and “Cancel my 3pm appointment”. You can speak naturally and the AI will understand your intent.

                  Why combine email management with driving time?

                <AccordionContent className="text-muted-foreground">
                  According to McKinsey, the average knowledge worker spends 2.6 hours a day on email and 1 hour a day in the car - these seem like the perfect two things to combine! Harmony allows you to productively manage your inbox during commutes, walks, or any time when you can’t look at your screen, making better use of your time.

                <AccordionContent className="text-muted-foreground">
                  Harmony currently integrates with Gmail for email management and Google Calendar for scheduling. We’re working on expanding support to other email providers and calendar services in future updates based on user feedback and demand.

                <AccordionContent className="text-muted-foreground">
                  No, Harmony cannot permanently delete emails. When you ask it to “delete” an email, it moves the email to your trash folder, ensuring that any mistakes are recoverable. This is one of our built-in safety measures to protect your important correspondence.

                  Harmony offers a 14-day free trial, then the subscription renews at USD $9.99 per month, converted to your local currency by Apple at the prevailing exchange rate.

                <AccordionContent className="text-muted-foreground">
                  Never. Harmony always asks for confirmation before sending any email. This ensures you maintain complete control over your email communications and prevents any accidental sends.

                <AccordionContent className="text-muted-foreground">
                  Harmony can help you manage your Google Calendar with voice commands. You can check your schedule, create new events, update existing appointments, cancel meetings, find free time slots, move events between calendars, and get reminders about upcoming meetings. Just ask things like “What’s on my calendar today?”, “Schedule a meeting with John tomorrow at 3pm”, or “When am I free this week?”

                <AccordionContent className="text-muted-foreground">
                  Yes! Harmony can analyze emails and help you create calendar events based on the content. If you receive a meeting request or need to schedule something mentioned in an email, just ask Harmony to “create a calendar event for this” and it will extract the relevant details like date, time, and participants to schedule the meeting.

                <AccordionContent className="text-muted-foreground">
                  Currently, Harmony connects to one Google Calendar account per subscription. You can access all the calendars within that Google account (personal, work, shared calendars, etc.) and Harmony can help you manage events across all of them. You can specify which calendar to use when creating events or move events between your different calendars.

                <AccordionContent className="text-muted-foreground">
                  Absolutely! Harmony can analyze your calendar to find free time slots that work for scheduling meetings. Just ask “When am I free this week for a 1-hour meeting?” or “Find me time for a 30-minute call with Sarah next Tuesday” and Harmony will suggest available time slots based on your existing calendar commitments.

                <AccordionContent className="text-muted-foreground">
                  Harmony follows NHTSA guidelines by keeping interactions completely hands-free and eyes-free, similar to talking to a passenger or taking a phone call. Most US states now require hands-free operation for device use while driving, which Harmony fully supports. You keep your hands on the wheel and eyes on the road at all times. However, like any conversation while driving, it does require some mental attention. We recommend using Harmony only when traffic conditions allow for safe conversation, just as you would with hands-free phone calls. Always prioritize safe driving and pull over if you need to handle complex email tasks.
